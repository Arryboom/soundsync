## FAQ

- *Is it Open-source ?* Soundsync is using the Business Source License. It is not open-source but free to use as long as you don't use it for production work. It means you can use it at home, in your office but you cannot resell it or sell a service/product that directly use it. If you have a special need, contact me.
